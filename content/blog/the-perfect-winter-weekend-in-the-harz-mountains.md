description: On our way back from Oranienburg, we decided to make a stop in the Harz mountains. We had a great time exploring the snowy landscape. I hadn't really experienced real winter like this in a long time.

    The city of Goslar

<p>Not far from where we stayed, we found the city of Goslar. It was a beautiful city with lots of old buildings and a great atmosphere. We had a great time exploring the city but we only went here a couple hours.</p>

    Lots of great walks

<p>The snowy mountains and the cold temperatures made for some great walks. We had a great time exploring the area. We will most definitely come back here in the future.</p>

    Gustav Adolf Stave Church

<p>Just next to where we stayed, we found the Gustav Adolf Stave Church. A beautiful church completely made out of wood. It was a nice sight to see.

    And even more walks...
</h2>
<p>We have experienced real cold temperatures with snow and ice but also some sunny days. It was easy to get our 20.000 steps each day.</p>

<p>And there we go! A great weekend in the Harz mountains. Next we will have to make sure to come back with a better telephoto lens to capture some of the wildlife. The cold rendered my current Canon 400mm F/5.6 lens useless. But maybe that helped me to focus more on the landscapes and pictures of me and my wife.
