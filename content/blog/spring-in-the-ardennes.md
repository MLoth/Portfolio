title: Spring in the Ardennes
description: During spring the Ardennes are a beautiful place to visit. The forests are full of life and the rivers are flowing with fresh water. We also had exceptional weather, which made it even more enjoyable. As always, some pictures and some pretty bad text.

<p>
  For my birthday, we went to the Ardennes. We stayed in a room near the Baraque Fraiture, which is the highest point in Belgium. The weather was exceptional, and we had a great time. We went for a walk in the forest and saw a lot of birds.

<p class="mb-6">
  When we saw all the marks of beavers in the landscape, we knew we had to see them. We went to a place where we could see them, and we were unlucky. We did however found some beautiful nature.

  Our host - who was also a guide - told us that the beavers were probably at another location. We went there the evening and saw them! We planned on having a relaxing weekend, but ended up on the same spot in the early morning to see the beavers again. It was worth it!

  We were affraid to come too close. We didn't want to disturb them. The didn't seem to mind us, swimming very close to us. However when wild boars came in the area they started warning each other with their tails. That was pretty cool...
