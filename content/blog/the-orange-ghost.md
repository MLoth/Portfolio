description: We had been looking to find a fox for some time. Then on an unexpected moment we found one. Right before nightfall, the fox searches the bins of the picnic site for leftovers.

The fox is a nocturnal animal so photographing one is not really easy. Often on Instagram you see these great pictures of cute foxes, but over here in Belgium that isn't really the case.
However during a warm evening when we were away on a picnic with our church youth group, we saw a fox when we left, right before sunset.

We went back there a couple of times and saw the same fox over and over again. Often it was getting very dark and the fox knew something was up, so we enjoyed the moment over getting closer or taking pictures.

If you want to see wildlife, the same rules apply every time. Be quiet, try to sit against the wind and be patient. And in the end, you might not see something after all. In that case, just enjoy the moment and the nature around you.
