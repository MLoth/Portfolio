title: Maize harvest
description: We live in a rural area and I love to look what's going on in the fields. This year, the maize harvest was a bit later than usual. I took my camera and went to the fields to take some pictures. It was also a nice opportunity to test my new polarizing filter. Here are some of the pictures I took.

  The light was absolutely perfect. I also like the effect of the polarizing filter. It makes the colors pop a bit more. However using spot metering wasn't the best idea.

  There you go! Just a little thing that happened and where I could try out my new filter. And when the sun is shining like this, everything looks so much better.

  I will have to test the filter in other situations as well. But I'm already happy with the results. I was expecting less vignetting, but I think it's not too bad. Most pictures are shot wide open at f/2.8. I will have to try f/4 to see if the vignetting is less.
