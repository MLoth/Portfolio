title: From winter to spring
description: This year, winter seemed to last a long time. The days were rainy, cold and often the best thing seemed to be to stay inside. This was good to code and read, but not so great for the away time from my laptop. Here are a couple of photos from this rather grey period inbetween winter and spring.

  Slowly the days started to get longer and more often birds could be heard. However, the weather was still cold and rainy.
