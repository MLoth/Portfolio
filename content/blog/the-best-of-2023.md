title: The best of 2023
description: A look back at the best of 2023. The year has mostly been about our renovation, but my wife and I also had some time to go out and enjoy nature. The best pictures however are mostly of friends and family. I will not share them here on the internet, but I will share some of the best nature pictures.

<h2 class="font-theme mb-6 text-3xl font-bold tracking-wide">A holiday in Germany</h2>

<p>
  I never got around to adding the pictures from this holiday to my blog. When went to the south of Germany and stayed with a friend. After a couple of days, we drove all the way from the Alps to my brother who lives in Berlin in the north. It was a wonderful trip and we saw a lot of beautiful places.

<p>
  During the normal working days, we also had some nice visitors in our garden and some nice trips around the country. Off course, we saw a lot of birds!

  Whenever we have some time, we love to go for a little trip somewhere in the Ardennes. We love the nature and the quietness. We also love to go backpacking and camping.

<p>
  Last year might have been the worst year for photography. I did not have a lot of time to go out and take pictures. I hope that next year will be better. I hope to go out more and take more pictures.
