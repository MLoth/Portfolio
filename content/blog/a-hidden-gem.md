title: A hidden gem
description: These are the best places in nature. The ones that are close to home. The places where you stroll on a regular evening. Where you know every little path and every tree. Where you can go to clear your mind after a long day of work and just be.  Take a look with me at some of my favourite moments in the small woods close to my home.

## An early love

<p>
  This place close to home is rather special. Back in the day, my grandparents used to take us here to go for a walk. It was a place where we could play and explore. I think that this memory has always stuck with me and might enable me to appreciate this place even more.

  Another nice aspect of visiting a place all throughout the year, is the way you can see it changing. You see the same places change from the icy winter-months to the green spring, to the hot summer and the colourful autumn. Also the behaviour and the sightings of the wild animals is very distinct in every season. Where you might see tens of roe deers in the summer, you might only see one or two in the winter. Very shy, ready to run off in the forrest.

In conclusion, this is only one of the many beautiful places around.
I hope that you will find your own hidden gem and that you will be able to appreciate it as much as I do. The beauty is all around us: during our commute, during a walk or in our backyard. Just take a look around, you'll see it.
