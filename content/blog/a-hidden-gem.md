title: A hidden gem
description: These are the best places in nature. The ones that are close to home. The places where you stroll on a regular evening. Where you know every little path and every tree. Where you can go to clear your mind after a long day of work and just be.  Take a look with me at some of my favourite moments in the small woods close to my home.

  This place close to home is rather special. Back in the day, my grandparents used to take us here to go for a walk. It was a place where we could play and explore.
