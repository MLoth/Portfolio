title: A fresh new year
description: For over a couple of years now, I've been going for a walk in the early hours of new year's day. It's a great way to start the year. Useually there is no one around and you have the whole world to yourself. This year, my wife and I were blessed with a beautiful sunrise.

::WrapText
This year, I might go for a more photo centered approach on the blogposts. I've been taking a lot of pictures and I think it would be nice to share them here. I do not like to write a lot, so I'll keep it short and let the pictures do the talking.
