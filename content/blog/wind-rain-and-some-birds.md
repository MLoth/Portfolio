title: Wind, rain & some birds
description: We took a trip to the coast last weekend. The weather was stormy, but we still had a great time. It wasn't always easy to find birds, but we got some nice moments!

<p>At first, near the coast we didn't see much. From time to time, we saw some smaller birds hanging on to smaller branches.</p>

<p class="mb-6">
  Near the visitor center, we suddenly saw some big birds of prey flying around. They were too far away to see what they were, but it was a nice sight.
</p>
<p>
  And all of a sudden, a bussard was just chilling in front of us. We were able to take some nice pictures of it. Still not sure if it was a young bird or a sick or tired one. It was however very close and didn't seem to mind us at all, rather unusual for a bussard.

  Later on, we came back and found some more birds. Whenever the sun burst through the clouds, the birds started to sing and fly around.

  We knew there was a possibility to see a stoat, but we didn't expect to see one. We were very lucky to see one, and even luckier to be able to take some pictures of it. They are incredibly fast and agile, so it was hard to get a good picture of it.
