<h2 class="font-theme mb-6 text-3xl font-bold tracking-wide">Design & development</h2>

<p class="mb-6">Over a couple of years, I have been developing on a lot of different things. I have been wondering what aspects I should touch in this post. I'll give you a brief overview of what I have been doing. If you're interested in more details, feel free to contact me.</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
  <li><strong>Vue frontend</strong> / At the moment this feels like the most stable and most robust frontend at the moment. But is it very, very close with some other options.</li>
  <li><strong>Express backend</strong> / A good scaling and secure backend, but looking back, I would have liked Nest.js more. Maybe one day...</li>
  <li><strong>CI/CD</strong> / Everything is versioned, tested, deployed to the Google Cloud Platform, etc. Testing can always be improved and I could (should) revisit the Docker setup.</li>
  <li><strong>Histoire component library</strong> / A great tool, but not the most stable at the moment. The Vite / Vue version of Histoire.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-6">The frontend you see here is just a small tip of the iceberg. As always, there is so much more behind the surface...</p>

<h2 class="font-theme mb-6 text-3xl font-bold tracking-wide">Photography & video</h2>

<p>At different occasions, I got the chance to take some pictures and videos. I love it.</p>
<p>Some pictures have been taken in a studio. We have rented a studio, we also used some lights in our office. I hope you can't see the difference. There was also a fun photoshoot in a elderly home.</p>
<p>These are the rough pictures, I have not done any editing yet. The final pictures have been edited and cleaned up.</p>
