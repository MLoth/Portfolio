At the Howest, I am a teacher in all kind of web development courses. I teach students how to build websites and web applications. I also teach them how to work in a team and how to work with clients.

The school environment has a great impact on the way you learn. Curious students keep you on your toes and make you think about what you teach and also the way you teach.</p>

<p class="mb-6">I love to teach and I love to learn. For me, the only way to be a good teacher, is to be a good learner and to keep learning every day. When I teach, I am always looking to bring students in the mindset of learning on their own and to help them solve problems.

<p>As a teacher and researcher, I have learned so much over the last years. I'm really happy for this opportunity and this wonderful job of teaching students.</p>
